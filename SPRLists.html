        <h1>Self Paced Reading Example: Critical Items</h1>
        <p> Recall the 2x2 example design we described earlier:
          <br/>
          <img title="Example Condition" alt="SPR Example Condition" src="Example.png"><br/>
          <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this design, a critical item consists of four conditions.
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I saw the apple</li>
        <li>I saw the kiwi</li>
        <li>I ate the apple</li>
        <li>I ate the kiwi</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
           We refer to the entire quadruple above as <em>one</em> critical item.
           So, for a typical experiment we will have to make many such critical
           items. Typically, self-paced reading experiments contains 6-8 times
           as many critical items as they contain conditions. Why do you think
           this is the case? Think about it for a moment and then quiz yourself.
        </p>

        <p>[ON: QUIZ HERE; four questions] Question 1: Why do you think the recommended number of
          critical items is function of the number of conditions? A) Because the
          number of conditions determines how motivated our participants will be.
          B-CORRECT) Because more conditions means that, for the same number of items, we
          will have fewer observation per condition. C) More critical items mean more
          statistical power. Question 2: How many critical items should our example experiment have?
          A) 18-24, B-CORRECT) 24-32, C)32-40, D) More than 40.
          Question 3: Can you think of a reason why it might be better to have 8 times as many items as conditions,
          rather than 6 times as many items as conditions? A) Participants can enjoy the experiment for a longer time.
          B) We will need fewer filler items. C-CORRECT) More items means more statistical power to detect an effect.
          Question 4:
          Can you think of a reason why it might be better to have 6 times as many items as conditions,
          rather than 8 times as many items as conditions? A-CORRECT) More items usually
          mean that a participant will see more stimuli. The longer our experiment
          will get, the higher the chance that participants will get tired or bored.
          B) Fewer items means more statistical power to detect an effect.
          C) Six is a prime number.

      <h1>Self-paced Reading: How to make good Critical Items</h1>
      <h2>Avoiding confounds</h2>
        <p>
          Recall how we said that we should try to
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">balance</a>
          all differences between (the critical items in the different) conditions,
          <em>except</em> for the differences that are intended by our manipulation?
        </p>

        <p>
          This is worth stressing again, because it is very important. If our
          manipulations (i.e., our conditions) are confounded with other differences
          that plausibly could affect our outcome variable (reading times), then
          we won't be able to draw reliable conclusions from our experiment.
        </p>

        <p>
          As already discussed, this means that we need to either hold constant
          (within any critical item) or at least balance (across all critical
          items) any differences across conditions. Have a look at
          the example critical item in Figure 1. Think of some
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">plausible confounds</a>?
          Are they held constant within this item? After you've thought
          a bit about this read on.
        </p>

        <p> Recall the 2x2 example design we described earlier:
          <br/>
          <img title="Example Condition" alt="SPR Example Condition" src="Example.png"><br/>
          <br/>
        </p>

        <p>The example item above holds many properties that we are not interested in
          constant between conditions. For example, in order to manipulate contextual
          predictability, the item is manipulating the verb ("ate" vs. "saw"). Can you
          think of a reason why we didn't use "devoured" instead of "ate"? "Devoured"
          is much longer than "saw", whereas both "ate" and "saw" are
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">mono-syllabic</a>.
          Both verbs also have exactly three letters. Word legnth is a strong
          predictor of reading times, with longer words taking longer to read.
          Another reason why we don't want to use "devoured" is that "devoured"
          is much less frequent than "saw". Like word length, word frequency
          might affect reading times--as a matter of fact that's one of the hypotheses
          we are testing! But we are testing this hypothesis for the words "apple" vs.
          "kiwi", so we don't want another region in the sentence that might create
          an additional frequency effect. Failing to do so would mean that the
          effects blend together (processing difficulty with a word often
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Spill-over means that the processing difficulty associated with a word leads to slower reading times on the immediately subsequent words.">spills over</a>),
          which might make them harder to tease apart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that similar, though slightly different, considerations apply to
          "apple" and "kiwi". For example, both words are
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">bi-syllabic</a>.
          They do differ in frequency, but that's ok: That's one of our <em>
          intended</em> manipulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The example item also holds constant between conditions many other variables
          known to affect reading times. For example, the target word is always
          equally far away from the sentence start and sentence end. Reading times
          are known to speed up throughout sentences, but then slow down at the
          boundary of
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">clauses</a> or
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">sentences</a>,
          as well as at line breaks, paragraph breaks, etc. The example item also
          holds constant the syntactic structure (and with it syntactic complexity,
          locality, etc.) and the position of the target word relative to that structure.
          All of these properties make this example item a good item.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many advantages to creating items that hold many properties
          constant. Any property that is held constant <em>within</em> all item
          is also automatically balanced <em>across</em> all items!
        </p>

        <p>
          Still there are a few properties that are not held constant. For example,
          "saw" and "ate" might differ slighlty in frequency
          (feel free to <a>look up their frequency</a>).<!--ON: please make this a link to
            the resource page and specifically the Frequency section.!-->
          This is the type of difference that we might want to try to
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">balance</a>
          across items.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many many other differences between the conditions of the example
          critical item, but
          only care about those that are
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">plausible confounds</a>.
          For example, "apple" and "kiwi" differ in more subtle aspects of their phonological structure.
          Whereas "apple" consists of a VCVC (vowel-consonant-vowel-consontant)
          sequence, "kiwi" consists of a CVCV sequence.
          VC sequence. It is theoretically possible that this affects reading items.
          But we won't worry about that because we have no reason to believe that
          this difference will have a particular large effect, if it has any
          effect at all.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron spr">
        <h2>Beyond confounds</h2>
        <p>
          In designing SPR experiments, researchers often go one step further than
          to just avoid confounds. Recall that it is ok, if property varies between
          items, as long as it balanced with regard to the conditions. In fact a
          little bit of variability across
          items is good in that it makes the sentences less predictable and less
          monotonous.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, we also don't want the different critical items to
          be completely different. The idea behind this is that one doesn't want
          to swamp the effect of interest in other differences between items that
          might cause much larger differences in readings. For this reason,
          experimenters often make critical items <em>similar to each other</em>.
          For example, we might vary the length the subject in our sentences from
          1 to, say, 3 words. But we might also want to keep all verbs in all
          critical items
          <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">transitive</a>.
          Additionally, it is often a good idea to not have critical items of
          widely varying syntactic complexity or length.
        </p>

      <div class="jumbotron spr">
        <h2>A few final considerations for critical items suited for self-paced reading</h2>
        <p>There are a few final consideration worth mentioning that are very particular to
          SPR experiments:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Line breaks:</em> If at
          all possible, we should avoid line breaks in critical items. If
          necessary, it is best if the sentence region of interest in the critical item is at
          least three words away from the beginning or end of a line.</li>
          <li><em>End of sentence:</em> If at
          all possible, the sentence region of interest should also be at least
          three words before the end of the sentence. The end of the sentence
          is often associated with large increases in reading times (presumably
          because of processes associated with understanding the sentence).</li>
          <li><em>Sentence length:</em>Unless your experiment is targeted at
            the consequences of complex and long sentences or for some other
            reason requires such sentences, it is generally a good idea to keep
            critical items simple (while still fulfilling the other constraints
            mentioned above).</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Self-paced Reading Example: Lists</h1>
        <p>You've learned a lot already. You're now close to completing the

          will do that for you. Still, it is a good idea to understand how Latin
          Square design and list creation works. So, just to refresh your memory,
          we've created this illustration for you.

          This example assumes that we have made 32 items (8 times as many items as
          conditions) in each of its four conditions (totaling 128 stimuli sentences).
