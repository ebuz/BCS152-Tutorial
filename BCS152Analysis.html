    <h4>Understanding SPR results</h4>

    <p>This guide will help you understand the SPR report you received with your data.
      <br>The report outlines what we did to clean up the data and how much data was
  excluded in the process of cleaning, a calculation of the mean question accuracy
  from your experiment, an analysis of the accuracy by condition to see if some of
  your conditions had different accuracy as compared to others, and finally an analysis
   of the residual reading times for each region of interest. </p>

    <h4>Example Report</h4>
    <p>The raw reading data has been cleaned with the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants were removed for having question accuracy lower than 80%</li>
        <li>Reading times were removed if the reading times were shorter than 100 msec or longer than 2000 msec</li>
        <li>Reading times were removed if they were 3 standard deviations away from the mean.</li>
      </ul>

          <br>The following table shows accuracy by condition.
          <br>Significance markers means that condition has a different accuracy as compared to the baseline condition.

      <figcaption>Reading times were residualized by word length and participant.
            <br>A model was fit analyzing residual reading times based on condition.
            <br><br>This table is a summary of each model.
            <br>Significance markers means that residual RTs differ for specific conditions as compared to the baseline condition.
