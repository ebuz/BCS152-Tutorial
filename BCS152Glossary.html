        <h4>Hypothesis</h4><!--Add in directional, non-directional, relational, casual-->
        <p>A hypothesis is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.<!--reword--> </p>
        <p>Example:<br>"I predict that the cold temperature will effect the growth of the marigolds."<br>
          "I predict reading times will be faster for sentences that have a higher distribution of high frequency words."
          <br>For more information on different types of hypothesis refer <a href="http://web.mst.edu/~psyworld/questions.htm">here</a></p>
        <h4>Variables</h4> <!-- Make a glossary/ index page-->
        <p>Variables is something that varies; something you can divide into parts. <br>Example: gender, size, weight, grades.</p>
          <p>Subset of variables are called <b>Levels</b></p>
          <p>Example: Temperature is an independent variable while the varying degress of temperature are Levels you are testing at (ie. 50F, 70F).</p>

        <h4>Factor</h4>
        <p>A controlled independent variable</p>
        <p>ie ... </p>

        <h4>Level</h4><!-- could get a better definition for this-->
        <p>Level of magnitude</p>
        <p>ie ...</p>

        <h4>Crossed</h4><!-- source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_experimental_design -- >
        <p>Two factors are crossed if every level of one occurs with every level of the other in the experiment.</p>
        <p>ie.... </p>

        <h4>Nested</h4>
        <p>A factor "A" is nested within another factor "B" if the levels or values of "A" are different for every level or value of "B". Note: Nested factors or effects have a hierarchical relationship.</p>
        <p>ie ... </p>

        <h4>Crossed and Nested</h4><!-- is this even a thing?-->
        <p></p>

        <h4>One-Factorial</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Two-Factorial</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Repeated Measurements</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Order Effects</h4>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Anova</h4>
        <p>A mathematical process for separating the variability of a group of observations into assignable causes and setting up various significance tests.</p>

        <h4>t-Test</h4>
        <p></p>

  			<h4>Participant</h4>
         <p>A participant in our experiments, can also be refered to as a subject.</p>


      		<h4>Session	</h4>
             <p>A session for which a participant comes in. This may contain one experiment, or it may combine several experiments. For our purposes we will only have one session per participant.</p>
      		<h4>Experiment</h4>
            <p> A set of lists of stimuli, of which each participant sees one. Each experiment may contain several embedded experiments. That is, we often run stimuli from several experiments mixed together, so that the item stimuli from one experiment can serve as fillers for the other and vice versa.
      		  </p>

      		<h4>Lists</h4>
              <p>Define in which order a participant will see the stimuli. An experiment typically has several lists, but each participant only sees one list. This is used to balance conditions across lists (and hence participants).
      		      </p>

      		<h4>Design</h4>
            <p>Experiments are determined by their design. We typically fully cross manipulations, leading to factorial designs, e.g. a 2 x 2 (manipulating two binary factors) leading to 4 conditions.
      		  </p>

      		<h4>Stimuli</h4>
            <p>Anything that constitutes one presentation (one trial), e.g. a picture to describe, a sentence to read, a word to remember, etc.
      		    </p>


      	<h4>Item</h4>
          <p>An item usually is a set of stimuli that only differ along the dimensions that define the conditions of the experiment (manipulations).
            <!-- take this and put it into the SPR section-->So, in a 2 x 2 design, each item has 4 conditions (= four different versions). There are between-item designs where this logic breaks down, but let's ignore this for now. The stimuli within an item should only differ as defined by the design. Everything else between them should be the same. E.g., here's an example item for a 2x2 design, crossing word frequency and predictability, where the target word is in italics:
            <ul>
          			a) High predictability, high frequency: He ate some pizza.<br>

          			b) High predictability, low frequency: He ate some kimchi.<br>

          			c) Low predictability, high frequency: He saw some pizza.<br>

          			d) Low predictability, low frequency: He saw some kimchi.<br>
              </ul>
      			Note that the different stimuli aim to hold the context (he ate/saw some) as constant as possible. We also generally aim to hold other factors that might matter constant. For example, in the above example item, all target words a bisyllabic (have two syllables) with stress on the first syllable. Additionally, both ate and saw are mono-syllabic, so that the target words is equally many syllables away both fro the start and the end of the sentence.
  			</p>

      		<h4>Filler</h4>
            <p>A stimulus that is not of primary interest for the question we want to address with the experiment. Fillers are held constant across lists. For more detail, see the Section on Fillers below.
