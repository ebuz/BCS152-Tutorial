        <p> This tutorial is aimed to teach you how to design and create your own
          experiment. It is set up in several sections. We have the general experiment
          design track, which should be the main track you follow. There is also a parallel
          track that explains the paradigm, Self-Paced Reading (SPR). You can follow the yellow buttons
          on the top and through the navigation for the SPR track.</p>
        <p>After the general part of the tutorial, there is an optional quiz. We highly
          recommend you take these quizzes. They will test to make sure you understand
          what you read, but will also be able to guide you with the materials you
          do not understand.</p>
        <p>For any items that are highlighted you can click on them and a pop-up
          will appear on the side. This will include defintiions, helpful links, other comments.</p>

        <h1>How Do I Create an Experiment?</h1>

      <p> The basics in helping you understand experimental design, terminology,
      and analysis with the ultimate goal in creating your own stimuli and experiment.</p>

      <h3>Start with Questions and a Hypothesis You Want to Explore</h3>

      <p>Have an interesting paper you read? Want to learn more on a topic? Just
        starting out and don't know where to look? Think about your interests within
        the class and topics you want to explore further. Why does this interest
        you? How will your project contribute to answering that question?
        What are ways you are going to implement your experiment? Start off with
        reading a paper or two, think about it critically and see what you would
        want to expand on or question. After you have a question you want to address,
        start brain storming a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A hypothesis
        is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.">hypothesis</a>
        to answer these questions.</p>

        <h4>I am a heading</h4>

        <p>A hypothesis is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.
         A question simply asks what the interaction would be between the two variables.
        </p>

         <p>Hypothesis: I predict reading times will be faster in condition A than condition B.
           <br>Question: What will the reading times be for condition A vs condition B?
        </p>

        <p>When thinking of a hypothesis you want to identify the
          <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Variables is something that varies; something you can divide into parts.
Example: gender, size, weight, grades.">variables</a> you want to test.</p>

        <p>Example: I predict that plants will grow better when they are played music.
          Variables in this are plants who are grown with music playing and plants who have no music playing.

    <h1>Self-Paced Reading Specific</h1>
    <p>As you go through this tutorial you will have the option of going through
      the self-paced reading (SPR) specific parallel tutorial. We suggest you go through
      the general tutorial first and then after go through the SPR specific tutorial.
      The navigation bar is coded so that you can reference back any section that you need.</p>
