      <h4>Within Subjects Designs</h4>
        <p>This design uses the <b>same subject</b> in <u>two different conditions</u> within the <b>same experiement</b>
        <br>If you have a subject participate in a design where they do set A and then set B. After test them on the same level to collect the results for analysis.
        <br>Example :<!--Can figure out my own example to give--> have a subject do anaerobic activity then do a memory task and then do aerobic activity and do a different memory task of the same difficulty and compare the results
        <br>Having a <b>high number</b> of subjects and <b>randomizing</b> the order of the study should give significant results when it is time to analyze the data.</p>

      <h4>2x2 Between Subjects Factorial Design</h4> <!-- add in the 2x2x2 and explain that--><!--more can be added in general-->
        <p>While is most of our other designs we have looked at one independent variable, a 2x2 design presents <b>another independent variable</b> that is going to be tested.<br>
        Example : Taking two indepedent variables (temperature and difficulty of a test) to be tested against different <bold>levels</bold> of temperature (50F, 70F) and difficulty (easy, hard)<br>

      <!-- create a table here in photoshop or something else, in this picture create arrows going to point out the levels, factors, etc in the 2x2 design-->
            <img src="Screen Shot 2015-04-24 at 11.02.28 AM.png"></p> <!-- go over other design 3x2 4x3x2(?)-->
          <p>What would a 3x2 design look like?</p> <!-- maybe make this like that the
        <!-- Make a picture showing that the 2 number listed (or 3) would be the independent variables while the listed numbers XxXxX would be the levels within the variable-->
        <p>In summary you would use <b>qualitatively independent variables</b> with <u>different levels</u> within the variables</p><!-- elaborate further-->

      <h4>2x2 Mixed Factorial Design</h4>
        <p>A combination of the first two designs, this design includes both between and within subjects. Each subject is given a pre-test and a post-test
        <br>Example: Depressed subjects are split into two groups of treatment. A baseline (pre-test) is given to both and then the treatment is done, followed by a post-test(experimental) to see the findings and results.
        <br>Discuss the pre-post-control design. One groups is the focus of the experiment (experimental) and the second is the base line(control).
        <br>Example :<!--full citation later--> :This design would consist of one within subject variable (test), with two levels (pre and post), and one between subjects variable (therapy), with two levels (traditional and cognitive)</p><!--Graph example-->

      <h4>Latin Square Design</h4><!--brief description, will go more indepth in the next class-->
        <p>A between-subject design that has the subject see each item one time, see all conditions equally, and across lists each items should be seen equally.</p>
        <p>This will go more indepth when describing the Self-Paced Reading paradigm.</p>
      <h4>How Do I Know Which Design is Best for Me?</h4><!--this could be a test question to see if they understand the different types of designs--><!--Javascript?-->
    </div>
       <!-- how do you I make this to ask a quesion?-->
       <!-- Should I talk about randomization in this part?-->
