        <h1>How Do I Create an Experiment?</h1>

      <p> The basics in helping you understand experimental design, terminology,
      and analysis with the ultimate goal in creating your own stimuli and experiment.</p>

      <h3>Start with Questions and a Hypothesis You Want to Explore</h3>

      <p>Have an interesting paper you read? Want to learn more on a topic? Just
        starting out and don't know where to look? Think about your interests within
        the class and topics you want to explore further. Why does this interest
        you? How will your project contribute to answering that question?
        What are ways you are going to implement your experiment? Start off with
        reading a paper or two, think about it critically and see what you would
        want to expand on or question. After you have a question you want to address,
        start brain storming a <a href="BCSGlossary.html#H" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A hypothesis
        is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.">hypothesis</a>
        to answer these questions.</p>


        <p>A hypothesis is a prediction about how you think your variables will
          interact with one another. For example think about high and low frequency words.
          You might come to a hypothesis that high frequency words will be read faster in
          a text than a word that you have rarely encountered. This is a hypothesis you can
          come up with, but would need to design an experiment to prove. You have some background
          evidence to build on this claim. <!-- (Reword somehowThe human brain would as a predictive language
          processing model since we have preconceived notions of what words should come next.
          Another hypothesis might be after you have run your experiment and you decide, well what
          happens if I put these words into a context. Will my subject have a faster reading time?-->
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>When thinking of a hypothesis you want to identify the
          <a href="BCSGlossary.html#V" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Variables is something that varies; something you can divide into parts.
Example: gender, size, weight, grades.">variables</a> you want to test.</p>

        <p>Example: I predict that plants will grow better when they are played music.
          Variables in this are plants who are grown with music playing and plants who have no music playing.
