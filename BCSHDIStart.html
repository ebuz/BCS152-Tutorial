        <h1>How Do I Create an Experiment?</h1>

      <p> The basics in helping you understand experimental design, terminology,
      and analysis with the ultimate goal in creating your own stimuli and experiment.</p>

      <h3>Start with Questions and a Hypothesis You Want to Explore</h3>

      <p>Have an interesting paper you read? Want to learn more on a topic? Just
        starting out and don't know where to look? Think about your interests within
        the class and topics you want to explore further. Why does this interest
        you? How will your project contribute to answering that question?
        What are ways you are going to implement your experiment? Start off with
        reading a paper or two, think about it critically and see what you would
        want to expand on or question. After you have a question you want to address,
        start brain storming a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A hypothesis
        is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.">hypothesis</a>
        to answer these questions.</p>

        <h4>I am a heading</h4>

        <p>A hypothesis is a prediction about how your variables interact with one another.
         A question simply asks what the interaction would be between the two variables.
        </p>

         <p>Hypothesis: I predict reading times will be faster in condition A than condition B.
           <br>Question: What will the reading times be for condition A vs condition B?
        </p>

        <p>When thinking of a hypothesis you want to identify the
          <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Variables is something that varies; something you can divide into parts.
Example: gender, size, weight, grades.">variables</a> you want to test.</p>

        <p>Example: I predict that plants will grow better when they are played music.
          Variables in this are plants who are grown with music playing and plants who have no music playing.
        </p>
