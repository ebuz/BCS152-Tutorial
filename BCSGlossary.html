    <h1>A</h1>
    <span class="word">Aba</span> a blah blah
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron A">
    <h1>B</h1>
    <span class="word">Amazon Mechanical Turk:</span> Online platform where researchers can post short experiments and tasks for workers (subjects) to complete <br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron I">
    <h1>C</h1>
    <span class="word">Comma Separated Value Format (CSV format):</span> Plain text document format in which columns of data are separated by a comma (or other delimiter, such as a tab). Very computer-friendly. You can create one of these files by saving as csv in Excel. <br>

    <span class="word">Confound:</span> Something in the experiment that might unintentionally affect the results. For example, to study how English speakers process a particular sentence structure in English, we may only want to run native, monolingual English speakers. Degree of nativeness or knowledge of another language might affect our results in unexpected ways and are potential confounds.<br>

    <span class="word">Control group:</span> The group of subjects that serves as a point of comparison for the experimental group. For example, in a clinical trial to test the efficacy of a new drug, the experimental group would receive the drug while the control group might receive a sugar pill instead. <br>
    <span class="word">Control variable:</span> Factors that are held constant in the experiment. For example, if we want to find out how sunlight affects plant growth, we would want to make sure all the plants receive the same amount of water and fertilizer, so that these factors will not affect our results. <br> 

  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron N">
    <h1>D</h1>
    <span class="word">Dependent Variable:</span> The variable that responds to the change made in the independent variable; this is the quantity or value that is being measured. For example, to test how sunlight affects plant growth, a researcher might vary the amount of sunlight (independent variable) different plants receive. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable because it <em>depends</em> on the independent variable.
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron B">
    <h1>E</h1>
    <span class="word">Eyetracker:</span> Technology used to measure the position of where the subject is looking in real-time. 
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron O">
    <h1>F</h1>
    <span class="word">Filler:</span> Items in the list that are used to make the subject unaware of what the experimenter is testing. E.g. If we are interested in reaction times to Sentence Structure A, we might also want to include some items that are of Sentence Structure B. 
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron R">
    <h1>G</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron A">
    <h1>H</h1>
    <span class="word">Hypothesis:</span> What the researcher expects the results of the experiment to be
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron I">
    <h1>I</h1>
    <span class="word">Independent Variable:</span> The part of the experiment that is changed by the researcher. For example, to test how sunlight affects plant growth, a researcher might vary the amount of sunlight (independent variable) different plants receive. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable because it <em>depends</em> on the independent variable.

  <div class="jumbotron B">
    <h1>K</h1>

  <div class="jumbotron O">
    <h1>L</h1>
    <span class="word">Lexical Decision Task:</span> Task in which a subject sees or hears a word, and has to determine whether it is a real word or a fake word (usually as quickly as possible). 
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron N">
    <h1>P</h1>
    <span class="word">Priming:</span> Effect in which exposure to one stimulus affects how quickly a subsequent one is processed.
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron B">
    <h1>Q</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron O">
    <h1>R</h1>
    <span class="word">Reaction Time (RT):</span> How quickly the subject is able to give a response
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron R">
    <h1>S</h1>
    <span class="word">Self-paced Reading (SPR):</span> Experimental paradigm in which words of a sentence are displayed one by one in response to the subject's actions (e.g. pressing a space bar on the computer). 
  </div>
