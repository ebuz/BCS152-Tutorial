	<h2> What is Latin Square Design?</h2>
	 <p>
		<br>We will use a Latin square experimental design in the self-paced reading studies.
    <br>We have scripts that will automatically create a Latin square from a specially formatted list of stimuli <a href="">(See stimuli creation).</a><!--page on stimuli creation-->
    <br><br>But, knowing what a Latin square design is and how to make one is something you should understand.


      <!--<ul>
        <li>First, it will be important to know the specifics of how participants saw your stimuli when you sit down to analyze your data.</li>
        <li>Second, it will let you interpret your findings with other experiments that both use this design or alternatives.</li>
      </ul>-->
<br>
		The idea behind a Latin square design <a href="BCS152Designs.html">(a between-subject design)</a> is to have each participant:
    <br><b>See each item exactly once
    <br>To see all conditions equally often
    <br>Across lists each item should be seen equally often in all its conditions.</b><br>
    Since each participants sees exactly one list of the experiment, this means that each list should contain each item only once (in one of its condition) and all conditions equally often.<br>
    One thing that follows from this is that the number of items that an experiment should have should be a multiple of the number of the experiment's conditions.<br>
    For power consideration, we often have between 6- to 8-times as many items as there are conditions in the experiment and an equal number of subjects, but that's another matter.<br>
    For more subtle effects, you may need even more items.

      <p>What is <a href="BCS152Glossary.html">stimuli?</a></p>
        <!-- Have a question on this and then after have it redirec to SPR before talking about SPR stimuli-->
        In a <!--define better-->within-participant Latin square design (which is what you will be running), <b>participants see this item once in one and only one of its conditions.</b> <!-- What does this mean to me?-->
      <!-- what if we use this to make a test questions?-->  <br>In this example:
        The first manipulation is to make the verb either
        <br><b>uninformative unconstraining</b>
        <br>(e.g. <font size="5">'saw'</font>; you can see many things and it doesn't cause you to generate any constraining expectations)
        <br>or
        <br><b>informative constraining</b>
        <br>(<font size="5">'ate'</font>; there is a much more constrained set of edible things in the world, generating an expectation of an edible noun).
        <br>The second manipulation is to make the final noun either high frequency (e.g. 'apple') or low frequency (e.g. 'kiwi').
        <br>In this design the experimenters are interested in reading times of the final noun (RT = reading time); you can have a different region of interest in your own study.

        <p>In this design the experimenters are manipulating the verb ('saw', 'ate') and final noun ('apple', 'kiwi'). This is an example of one item with four conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>I saw the apple</li>
            <li>I saw the kiwi</li>
            <li>I ate the apple</li>
            <li>I ate the kiwi</li>
          </ul>
