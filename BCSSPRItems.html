        <h1>Self Paced Reading Item Example</h1>
        <!-- Note: This is from the critical item page of the wiki. May need to be placed somewhere else-->
            <p>
              The sentences here are only different as it relates to the manipulations.
              That is everything is held constant except for the portions that are part
              of the experimental design: I __ the __. Design your items to be like
              this too (for another example see the stimuli below). Notice that the
              manipulations are also very controlled. In the example above the verbs
              are both one syllable and equally frequent, the difference between them
              is minimized as much as possible to how constraining they are. The final
              nouns are also very similar: both have two syllables. The region of interest
              is held constant too, the final noun is the same distance from both the
              start and end of the sentence.

          Here is an example of stimuli from a 2x2 design with a box around the
          critical words:<br>
          <br>
          <img title="Example Condition" alt="SPR Example Condition" src="Example.png"><br>
          <br>
          In this design the experimenters are manipulating the verb ('saw',
          'ate') and final noun ('apple', 'kiwi'). This is an example of one item
          with four conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I saw the apple</li>
        <li>I saw the kiwi</li>
        <li>I ate the apple</li>
        <li>I ate the kiwi</li>
      </ul>
        <p>In a within-participant Latin square design (which is what you will be
          running), participants see this item once in one and only one of its
          conditions. The first manipulation is to make the verb either
          uninformative unconstraining (e.g. 'saw'; you can see many things and it
          doesn't cause you to generate any constraining expectations) or
          informative constraining ('ate'; there is a much more constrained set of
          edible things in the world, generating an expectation of an edible
          noun). The second manipulation is to make the final noun either high
          frequency (e.g. 'apple') or low frequency (e.g. 'kiwi'). In this design
          the experimenters are interested in reading times of the final noun (RT
          = reading time); you can have a different region of interest in your own
          study.</p>
      <h3>Some notes on critical items</h3>
        <p>The sentences here are only different as it relates to the
          manipulations. That is everything is held constant except for the
          portions that are part of the experimental design: I __ the __. Design
          your items to be like this too (for another example see the stimuli
          below). Notice that the manipulations are also very controlled. In the
          example above the verbs are both one syllable and equally frequent, the
          difference between them is minimized as much as possible to how
          constraining they are. The final nouns are also very similar: both have
          two syllables. The region of interest is held constant too, the final
          noun is the same distance from both the start and end of the sentence.</p>
