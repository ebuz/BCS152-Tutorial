        <h1>Design</h1>
          <p>Once you have a research question and a hypothesis about how the
            independent variables of interest interact with the dependent variable,
            the next step is to develop the experimental design. </p>

          <p>Experimental design is the means by which hypotheses are operationalized.
             In other words, experimental design is how you collect controlled observations
              (i.e., data) about the relationship among the variables of interest.</p>

          <p>The first step in experimental design is to specify the conditions
            (e.g., test conditions and control conditions) that allow you to test
            your hypothesis. Consider the simple hypothesis that Variable A causes
             Outcome X. To confirm this cause-effect relationship, you must demonstrate
             that both of the following propositions are true:</p>

             <ul>
              <li>(i) If variable A occurs, then outcome X occurs.</li>
	            <li>(ii) If variable A does not occur, then outcome X does not occur.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Thus, this simple hypothesis requires an experiment with two conditions:
            Condition A, in which variable A is presented; and Condition B in which
            variable A is not presented.
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Design</h2>
          <p>There are many types of experimental designs. Choosing the most
            appropriate design depends on your hypotheses and the nature of the
            independent variables.</p>

            <h3>Within Subjects Designs</h3>
              <p>In a within-subjects design, every subject is exposed to every
                condition of the experiment. For example, if your research question
                concerns how reading times for the final word of a sentence are
                affected by semantic predictability (i.e., whether the final word
                is predictable from the preceding context), you might design an
                experiment with two conditions: one condition involving high
                predictability sentences (e.g., I ate the apple), and the other
                condition involving low predictability sentences (e.g., I saw the apple).
                For a within-subjects design, each participant would respond to
                both high and low predictability sentences. One of the benefits
                of a within-subjects design is that you can measure the effect of
                experimental conditions on performance, while accounting for individual
                differences between participants (e.g., measuring the difference in
                reading times for high and low predictability sentences while
                accounting for the fact that people vary in their baseline reading speech). </p>

            <h3>Between Subjects Design</h3>

              <p>In a between-subjects design, the independent variables are
                manipulated between subjects. That is, each participant is only
                exposed to a specific subset of the experimental conditions.
                For example, one group of subjects is assigned to Condition A and
                another group of subjects is assigned to Condition B. A between
                subjects design is necessary when the independent variable involves
                properties of the participants that vary across individuals (e.g.,
                monolinguals vs. bilinguals; children vs. adults; fast readers vs.
                slow readers). In some cases, a within-subjects design is logically
                possible, but a between subjects design is more appropriate because
                exposure to one condition is likely to have a systematic and undesirable
                influence on performance in another condition (e.g., ...).</p>

            <h3>Mixed (between-and-within subjects) design</h3>
              <p>In a mixed design, some independent variables are manipulated
                within subjects and some variables are manipulated between subjects.
                For example, consider that you want to investigate the effect of
                semantic predictability on reading times among both young and
                elderly adults. Age group is manipulated between subjects (because
                a given person can only fall into one of the relevant age categories).
                But both age groups are presented with high and low predictability
                sentences: i.e., semantic predictability is manipulated within subjects.</p>
