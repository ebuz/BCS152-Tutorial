        <h1>Design</h1>
          <p>
            Once you have a research question, hypothesis, and prediction, the next step is
            to develop the experimental design. In this section, we talk about the basics of
            experimental design, participants, and items.
          </p>


        <h2>Operationalizing a design</h2>
          <p>
            Experimental design is the means by which hypotheses are operationalized.
             In other words, experimental design is how you collect controlled observations
              (i.e., data) about the relationship among the variables of interest. Note that
            our hypotheses often involve predictors that are
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">continuous variables</a>.
            The predictor variable we've discussed on the previous page--the relative frequency
            of words--is an example of a continuous predictor. For the purpose of experimental
            designs, continuous predictors are often <em>binned</em> into a small number of bins
            (though this is not always desirable, it is a common convention and for the current
            purpose, it will make it easier to talk about the design options you have for your
            experiment). Binning turns continuous variables into
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">categorical variables</a>.
            For example, we might bin words based on their relative frequency into "high" and "low"
            frequency words.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are also variables that are naturally considered categorical. For example, if
            we hypothesized that nouns are read more quickly than verbs, "noun" vs. "verb" would
            be a categorical predictor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just like predictors, outcomes can be continuous or categorical. Reading times are an
            example of a continous outcome. The accuracy of an answer to a comprehension question
            (which is either true or false) is an example of a categorical outcome.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron ex">
        <h2>Conditions</h2>
          <p>
            The first step in experimental design is to specify the conditions
            (e.g., test conditions and control conditions) that allow you to test
            your hypothesis. The conditions describe how we plan to manipulate
            our <a href="BCSGlossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">predictor variables</a>.
            The goal of this manipulation is to test whether we will observe the
            change in the <a href="BCSGlossary.html#O" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">outcome variables</a>
            predicted by our hypothesis.
          </p>

          <p>
            To continue the example introduced above, consider that we plan to bin
            relative frequency into "high" and "low" frequency words. We would then
            design our experiment to have a high-frequency condition and a low-frequency
            condition. <b>Our prediction would be that reading times will be faster in
            the high-frequency condition than in the low-frequency condition.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Without further additions, we would call this a <b>by-2 design</b>, because we
            have one predictor variable in two conditions and there are no other
            manipulations in the experiment. We will go through a more detailed example
            on the next page, but first we'll establish a little bit more terminology.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="jumbotron ex">
        <h2>Participants</h2>
          <p>
            Another important design decision is <em>what type</em> of participant
            and <em>how many</em>
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">participants</a>
            your experiment should have.
          </p>

        <h3>Type of participants</h3>
          <p>
            The type of participant you should administer depends on the
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">population</a>
            your hypothesis is about. When we run participants, we assume that
            these participants are independently sampled from the population.
            This is a critical assumption, because we want the participants to
            be <em>representative</em> for the population. It is because of this
            assumption that we feel we can take the results of our experiments
            as evidence that speaks to the likelihood that our hypothesis holds
            for the population of interest. To continue the example from above,
            we might hypothesize that any healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems reads high-frequency words more quickly than
            low-frequency words. In that case "healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems" would be our population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that we often make simplifying assumptions in selecting our
            participants. For example, college students are most likely <em>not</em>
            a representative example of the average "healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems". Yet, it is commonly accepted to generalize
            from college student participants to the larger population of English
            speakers.
          </p>

        <h3>Number of participants</h3>
          <p>Think about it: Why aren't we just administering a single participant for
            our experiment? You probably have the intuition that this would be problematic.
            For one thing, there's only so much data we can get from one participant
            before that person gets tired or bored (and start providing less and less
            reliable data). But you probably also have the intuition that there's another
            reason beyond this. Even if we had thousands of data points from a single
            participants, we might wonder whether it is just something idiosyncratic
            about that participant that gives us those results. For example, what if
            that one participant--despite our best efforts to screen for it--has some
            form of dyslexia or other deficits that will affect how that participant
            reads? In that case, the participant would not be representative of our
            target population. This problem of representativeness is arguably particularly
            severe for experiments on aspects of higher-level cognition (including
            language), because there's more individual variation with regard to those
            aspects of cognition.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, we typically want to administer quite a few participants, in order
            to feel confident that our results will generalize to the population of
            interest. But how many participants is enough?
            On the one hand, more participants cost more
            money and it can also take longer to recruit them, delaying the completion
            of your experiment. On the other hand, more participants make it more likely
            that we obtain
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#R" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">reliable results</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            One important distinction is between the overall number of participants
            you plan to administer and the number of
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">successful participants</a>
            you plan to administer. As we will discuss later, we sometimes have to exclude
            participants from the analysis. This could happen, for example, because there
            was a technical problem and no responses were recorded from them. Or the participant
            fails to meet a priori defined
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#I" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">inclusion-criteria</a>.
            It is the number of <em>successful</em> participants that determines how reliable
            your results will be.
          </p>

          <p>
            How many participants we should administer in an experiment is often a
            complicated question. But there are rules of thumb. First, if you are
            conducting an experiment that is very similar to previous experiments,
            have a look at how many participants these experiments employed. Also
            ask yourself whether those experiments obtained reliable results: Were
            there results clearly significant (or just barely significant)? Were
            there several studies and they all replicated
            the significant result with approximately the same number of participants?
            If previous work suggests that the effect is somewhat unreliable (e.g.,
            if previous work always reports significance values <em>just</em> below
            p<.05), you might want to plan to administer more participants than
            previous work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending how comfortable you are with statistics, you can also run
            <a href="BCSGlossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">power simulations</a>,
            in which you assess how likely you would be to
            find an effect under certain assumptions about the size of the hypothesized
            effect (based on previous experiments).
          </p>

          <p>
            Regardless of how you decide how many participants to administer for
            your experiment, the most important thing is that you make this decision
            <em>before you start collecting data</em>. If you start to run you experiment
            and then decide later to add further participants, then you risk biasing
            your results.

        </div>
      <div class="jumbotron ex">
        <h2>(Critical) Items</h2>
          <p>In addition to participants, another important component of (language)
            experiments are items. To a first approximation, items are the stimuli
            we use in our experiment (we'll have more to say about that later). For
            the same reasons that we want to have multiple participants--our goal to
            be able to confidentially generalize from our sample to the population--
            we also want several items in our experiment. We can think of stimuli in
            ways similar to participants. Any particular word, for example, might
            have individual properties <em>beyond the ones we are interested in for
            our experiment</em> and we want to be sure that whatever results we obtain
            hold beyond those individual properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like with participants, we can look at previous experiments to see
            how many items our experiment should contain. A useful rule of thumb is
            also to have equally many items and participants.
          </p>
        </div>
      <div class="jumbotron ex">
        <h2>Types of Design</h2>
          <p>There are many types of experimental designs. Choosing the most
            appropriate design depends on your hypotheses and the nature of the
            independent variables.</p>

            <h3>Within-Participant Designs</h3>
              <p>In a within-participant design, all predictor variables are
                manipulated within participants, so that every participant is
                exposed to every condition of the experiment.</p>

              <p>Consider our example by-2 design described above, manipulating
                word frequency. As already described, there would be two conditions:
                high-frequency vs. low-frequency.
                For a within-participant design, each participant would respond to
                both high- and low- frequency words.</p>

              <p>One of the benefits
                of a within-participant design is that you can measure the effect of
                experimental conditions on performance, while accounting for individual
                differences between participants (e.g., measuring the difference in
                reading times for high- and low-frequency words while
                accounting for the fact that people vary in their baseline reading speech).</p>

              <p><a href="http://web.mst.edu/~psyworld/within_subjects.htm" target="_blank">Further reading</a>.</p>

            <h3>Between Subjects Design</h3>
              <p>In a between-participant design, all predictor variables are
                manipulated between participant. That is, each participant is only
                exposed to a subset of the experimental conditions, possibly just one
                of condition.</p>

              <p>For our example, one group of subjects would see only high-frequency
                words, whereas another group of subject would see only low-frequency
                words.</p>

             <p>Note that, the same number of participants in a between-participant
               design provideless statistical power to detect an effect than in a
               within-participant design. There's an intuitive reason behind this:
               in a between-participant design, any difference that is caused by the
               design manipulation (e.g., high- vs. low-frequency words) now needs to
               have an effect <em>over and above individual differences between
               participants</em>. This means that the effect of the manipulation
               will be harder to detect.</p>

               <p>However, a between-participant design is sometimes inevitable,
                 for example, when your hypothesis (and thus the predictor variables) involves
                 properties of the participants that vary across individuals (e.g.,
                 monolinguals vs. bilinguals; children vs. adults; fast readers vs.
                 slow readers). In other cases, a within-participant design is logically
                 possible, but a between-participant design is more appropriate because
                 exposure to one condition is likely to have a systematic and undesirable
                 influence on performance in another condition.</p>

              with a non-language example.</p>


            <h3>Mixed (between-and-within participant) design</h3>
              <p>In a mixed design, some independent variables are manipulated
                within participant and some variables are manipulated between participant.</p>

              <p>Finally, note that design questions similar to those that we have
                discussed here for participants can also come up with regard to
                items. In that case, we talk off within-item, between-item, and
                mixed (item) designs.
